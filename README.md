# ES6-

# Level 1
Modify from traditional functions to ES6 arrow functions. Moreover, I had to solve some challenges. The code for this level can be found in js/script.js.

# Level 2
Create a program in ES6 with at least 1 function. This program asks you for two numbers from 1 to 10 (number and range) through a submit form. The result is the multiplication table with the number and range chosen. You can find this code in HTML (index.html), CSS (styles/styles.css) and JS (js/main.js).

# Level 3
Create a search list bar of a given list. You can find the code in HTML (searcher.html), CSS (styles/App3.css) and JS (js/search.js).

# Demo
Here you can find a demo: https://ain12.github.io/ES6-/  In order to view level 3 App, theres a black button called "Level 3 App" in the main page (index.html).
